My name is Brian Becker. I have been programming most of my life, from the early days of Commodore64 and Basic. I have tought myself how to build apps using Excel and Access, Visual Basic (back in the day), and most recently, Ruby and Rails. Software has always been a passion, and now I am cultivating a new career path for myself in this field!

I learned Ruby on Rails by going through [Micheal Hartl Ruby on Rails Tutorial][ruby-on-rails-tutorial-home], twice, along with [CodeSchool][codeschool-home] and [Codecademy][codecademy-home]. I have used Ruby on Rails to hack on a couple sites, and came to the conclusion that I really liked it!

Enter [LaunchSchool][launchschool-home]: 
LaunchSchool.com is an online, self-paced Ruby and Rails school that teach fundimentals of Ruby first, then dive into the inner workings of Rails so that their students get the most in-depth look at the Rails framework and how everything fits together.

**Ruby - For Future Reference** is my blog that I am putting together as I progress through the Tealeaf courses, and ultimatly as a web developer going forward.
